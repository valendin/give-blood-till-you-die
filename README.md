Demonstration of Probabilistic BTYD models

Short example in R

Pareto/NBD model was introduced by Schmittlein et al in 1987, later simplified by Fader (2004) into the BG/NBD model.
Pareto/GGG is an advanced variation invented by Platzer & Reutterer (2016), implemented by Platzer in the BTYDplus package: https://github.com/mplatzer/BTYDplus
